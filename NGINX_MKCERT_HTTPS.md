# Using Nginx and mkcert for HTTPS Access

This document describes how to configure HTTPS access for the Atlassian DC MCP service using Nginx and mkcert.

## Overview

[mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is a simple tool for local HTTPS development that can create locally trusted development certificates. Combined with Nginx reverse proxy, we can provide HTTPS access for the MCP service.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Install the mkcert tool

## Installing mkcert

### macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if using Firefox browser
```

### Linux

On Linux, you need to install the mkcert binary:

```bash
# Download the latest version of mkcert
wget https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/download/v1.4.4/mkcert-v1.4.4-linux-amd64
chmod +x mkcert-v1.4.4-linux-amd64
sudo mv mkcert-v1.4.4-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert
```

## Create Local CA and Generate Certificates

1. Install the local CA:

```bash
mkcert -install
```

This will install the local CA in the system, making all certificates generated by mkcert trusted.

2. Create the certs folder in the project directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ./certs
cd ./certs
```

3. Generate local development certificates:

```bash
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

This will generate two files:
- `localhost+2.pem` (certificate file)
- `localhost+2-key.pem` (private key file)

## Configuring Nginx

The project already includes the Nginx configuration file [nginx-config/nginx.conf](nginx-config/nginx.conf), which contains:

1. HTTP to HTTPS redirection
2. SSL certificate configuration
3. Reverse proxy to the MCP service

## Starting the Service

Use the following commands to start the service with Nginx:

```bash
# Build and start the service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yml up -d

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yml logs -f
```

## Verifying the Configuration

After starting the service, you can access the MCP service through the following URLs:

- HTTPS: https://localhost/sse
- HTTP: http://localhost (will automatically redirect to HTTPS)

## Configuring AI Assistant

When configuring the MCP service in your AI assistant, use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "atlassian-dc-mcp-sse": {
      "url": "https://localhost/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Jira-Token": "your-jira-api-token",
        "Confluence-Token": "your-confluence-api-token",
        "Bitbucket-Token": "your-bitbucket-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Not Trusted

If the browser still indicates that the certificate is not trusted, make sure:

1. You have correctly run `mkcert -install`
2. Restart your browser
3. On Linux, you may need to manually install the certificate in the system or browser

### Port Conflicts

If ports 80 or 443 are already in use, you can modify the port mapping in [docker-compose.nginx.yml](docker-compose.nginx.yml):

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:80"
  - "8443:443"
```

Then access the service via https://localhost:8443.

### Cannot Connect to MCP Service

Check the following:

1. Is the MCP service running correctly: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yml logs mcp-server`
2. Is the Nginx configuration correct: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.nginx.yml logs nginx-proxy`
3. Is the network connection normal: Ensure both containers are on the same network

## Production Environment Considerations

This configuration is only suitable for development and testing environments. In production environments, you should:

1. Use valid SSL certificates (such as Let's Encrypt)
2. Configure appropriate firewall rules
3. Strengthen Nginx security configuration
4. Use appropriate load balancing and high availability configurations
